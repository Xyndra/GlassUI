= GlassUI

Note: Deep in development, not ready for use yet.

GlassUI basically tries to reproduce the look of the https://hyprland.org/hall_of_fame/[hot linux setups] that you see every now and then on Windows(only latest will be actively supported).

- [ ] Replacing the taskbar (and add a lot more features)
- [ ] Making window transparency settable
- [ ] Creating custom desktop backgrounds

- [ ] Add optional screen effects (for example a beating depending on the music)
- [ ] Replacing the start and search menu
- [ ] Replacing the file explorer
- [ ] Replacing the tab switching menu
- [ ] Replacing the text editor
- [ ] Creating a twm
